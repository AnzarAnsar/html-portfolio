<h3>Bilal: A New Breed of Hero (2015)</h3>
<p>This movie talks about racial discrimation that was much prevalent 1400 years 
    ago and how the human trafficking was at peak at that time.
    The main character i.e. Bilal comes out of all this and at
    the climax, he rise victorious over all those social evils.
